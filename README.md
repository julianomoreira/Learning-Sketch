# Learning Sketch 3

I may be a little late to this Sketch bandwagon, but I spent one weekend playing with it and fell in love with its easiness to use. I created this repository to share my design exercises as in attempt to learn and explore Sketch to its full potential. If you come across this repository and would like to contribute to this repo, please submit your own designs and share tips and techniques with us through this repo. Feel free to clone this repo and modify/improve any files you find here as long as you share what you've done. If you have any questions or suggestions, you can find me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/iammrjuju).
